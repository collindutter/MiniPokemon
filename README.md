### Mini Pokemon

Mini Pokemon (unofficial name) was a project for CPE 123 done entirely by myself, Brandon Kelly, and Allison Lee in around 2 weeks. I'm currently unable to create working executables, so until then I fix that, you'll need to download [Processing](https://processing.org) and run it yourself.
