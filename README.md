# Mini Pokemon

Mini Pokemon (unofficial name) is an (extremely) scaled down version of Pokemon Saphire made for CPE 123. It was programmed entirely entirely by myself, Brandon Kelly, and Allison Lee in around 2 weeks. I'm currently unable to create working executables, so until then I fix that, you'll need to download [Processing](https://processing.org) and run it yourself. Use the arrow keys along with 'Enter' to navigate the game!

## Tech
Mini Pokemon was programmed in [Processing](Processing.org).

## Downloads
Processing 3 is giving me a hard time when it comes to creating executables. For now, you can run the source in the [Processing](Processing.org) IDE.
