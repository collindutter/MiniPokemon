### Mini Pokemon

Mini Pokemon (unofficial name) was a project for CPE 123 done entirely by myself, Brandon Kelly, and Allison Lee in around 2 weeks. You can play it for yourself by heading over to the "Releases" section and downloading the executable for your system! Use the Enter key and the arrow keys to navigate the game.
